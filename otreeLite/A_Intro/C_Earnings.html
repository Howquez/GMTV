    The experiment will consist of {{ session.config.num_rounds }} decision making periods.
    At the beginning of the experiment, you will be matched with {{ group_members }} other people
    in this room. Therefore, there are {{ session.config.group_size }} people, including
    yourself, participating in your group.
    You will be matched with the same people during the entire experiment.
    None of the participants knows anything about other participants' identities.
</p>
<p>
    Before the first period you, and each other person in your group, will be given the
    <b>endowment of {{ session.config.initial_endowment }} tokens</b>.
</p>
<p>
    At the beginning of the first period you will be asked to allocate your endowment between a
    private account and a group account.
</p>

    Accounts & Returns
</h5>
<hr class="mt-0">
<p>
    The tokens that you place in the <b>private account</b> have a return of 1 at the end of the
    first period. This means that at the end of the first period your private account will
    contain exactly the amount of tokens you put into the private account at the beginning of
    the period. Nobody except yourself benefits from your private account.
</p>
<p>
    The tokens that you place in the <b>group account</b> are summed together with the tokens
    that the other three members of your group place in the group account. Regardless of how
    many tokens you contributed to the group account, you as well as the other members of your
    group will get a share of that sum of tokens.
</p>
<p>
    The exact <b>quota</b> determining your share varies, which is why we will display
    it on your decision screen in each period. More precisely, the return you receive from the
    group account depends on how your endowment compares to the whole group's endowments. In case
    you have an endowment while the other group members have nothing, the
    quota will equal {{min_mpcr}}%. If, in contrast, you have no endowment but some other
    group member has an endowment, the quota equals {{max_mpcr}}%. This relationship is visualized in the following
    figure.

<p>
    Your endowment at the beginning of the second period will be equal to the amount of tokens
    contained in your private account at the end of the first period plus your share of the
    group account at the end of the first period.
</p>
<p>
    At the beginning of the second period you will be again asked to allocate the endowment that
    you have at the beginning of the second period between a private account and a group account.
    Both the private and the group account work in exactly the same manner as in the first
    period, namely, they have the same returns.
</p>
<p>
    The structure of the experiment at all subsequent periods is identical: your endowment at
    the beginning of each period is equal to the amount of tokens in your private account at
    the end of the previous period plus your share of the group account at the end of the
    previous period.
</p>
<p>
    <b> Your total income in the end of the experiment is equal to the amount of tokens in your
    private account and your share of the group account at the end of period
        {{session.config.num_rounds}}</b>. At the end
    of the experiment there will be a short questionnaire for you to fill in.

    Information
</h5>
<hr class="mt-0">
<p>
    In each period you will be informed about
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The endowment all four group members had at the beginning of the period.</li>
    <li>How much each group member allocated to the group account and to their respective private accounts.</li>
    <li>Your share of the group account (remember it is the same for all group members).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All other participants will receive exactly the same information.
