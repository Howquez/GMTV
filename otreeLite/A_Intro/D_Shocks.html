<p>
    There is a chance of {{ risk }}% that a shock occurs. Such a shock may reduce your
    endowment to up to {{ damage }}%. While you do not have any influence on the
    occurence of a shock, you can affect the damage it evokes.
</p>
<p>
    The more you and the rest of your group contribute to the group account, the smaller the
    damage if a shock occurs. Conversely, the lower the contributions, the higher the damage if
    a shock occurs.
</p>
<p>
    More precisely, there won't be any damage if everybody in the group contributes his or her
    whole endowment to the group account &#8211 even if there was a shock. If none of you
    contributes anything to the group account, a shock will cause a damage of {{ damage }}% of
    the endowments of each and every one of you.

    Note that we provide a calculator behind the <i class="bi bi-calculator"></i>-symbol. It
    takes the abovementioned formula und helps you to consider different cases. As such, it is
    most important that you understand that higher contributions lead to lower damage and
    vice versa.
