## Overview

The code provided in this repository constructs the analysis of my
article using R, RMarkdown as well as quarto and, importantly, a
literate programming approach. It is based on data stemming from two
different sources: GÃ¤chter, Mengel, Tsakas & Vostroknutov (2017,
hereafter, GMTV) as well as my own. For transparency reasons, I provide
two sets of code: (1) code that refers to the article I planned to write
when I designed your study and (2) code referring to the article that
makes the most sense after collecting the data.

1.  **Pre-registered code**: consists of multiple R and RMarkdown files
    that guide the replicator through the pre-processing and preliminary
    analyses.

2.  **The article's code**: consists of one quarto file that not only
    reproduces the complete final analysis but also the written article
    interpreting the corresponding results.

The replicator should expect the code to run for about 15 minutes.

## Data Availability and Provenance Statements

> INSTRUCTIONS: - When the authors are **secondary data users** (they
> did not generate the data), the provenance and DAS coincide, and
> should describe the condition under which (a) the current authors (b)
> any future users might access the data. - When the data were generated
> (by the authors) in the course of conducting (lab or field)
> **experiments**, or were collected as part of **surveys**, then the
> description of the provenance should describe the data generating
> process, i.e., survey or experimental procedures: - Experiments:
> complete sets of experimental instructions, questionnaires, stimuli
> for all conditions, potentially screenshots, scripts for experimenters
> or research assistants, as well as for subject eligibility criteria
> (e.g. selection criteria, exclusions), recruitment waves, demographics
> of subject pool used. - For lab experiments specifically, a
> description of any pilot sessions/studies, and computer programs,
> configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment. - For
> surveys, the whole questionnaire (code or images/PDF) including survey
> logic if not linear, interviewer instructions, enumeration lists,
> sample selection criteria.
>
> The information should describe ALL data used, regardless of whether
> they are provided as part of the replication archive or not, and
> regardless of size or scope. The DAS should provide enough information
> that a replicator can obtain the data from the original source, even
> if the file is provided.
>
> For instance, if using GDP deflators, the source of the deflators
> (e.g. at the national statistical office) should also be listed here.
> If any of this information has been provided in a pre-registration,
> then a link to that registration may (partially) suffice.
>
> DAS can be complex and varied. Examples are provided
> [here](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html),
> and below.
>
> Importantly, if providing the data as part of the replication package,
> authors should be clear about whether they have the **rights** to
> distribute the data. Data may be subject to distribution restrictions
> due to sensitivity, IRB, proprietary clauses in the data use
> agreement, etc.
>
> NOTE: DAS do not replace Data Citations (see
> [Guidance](Data_citation_guidance.md)). Rather, they augment them.
> Depending on journal requirements and to some extent stylistic
> considerations, data citations should appear in the main article, in
> an appendix, or in the README. However, data citations only provide
> information **where** to find the data, not **how to access** those
> data. Thus, DAS augment data citations by going into additional detail
> that allow a researcher to assess cost, complexity, and availability
> over time of the data used by the original author.

My article compares (1) data from GMTV to (2) data I generated by
running their experimental paradigm with different sample drawn from a
different population in a different situation.

1.  I retrieved `GMTV-data.dta` in June 2020 from the authors appendix
    that can be found
    [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272717300361#s0115).
    More precisely, I downloaded `Supplementary Material 2` where the
    file is stored in `Data and Stata Code`. Furthermore, I contacted
    the authors to request a file called `GMTV-questionnaire-data.dta`
    via eMail.

2.  I generated my own data running an online experiment using oTree
    software (Chen et al.,2016) I provide
    [here](https://github.com/Howquez/coopUncertainty/tree/July21Replication/oTree).
    The corresponding data is stored in two folders (4 csv-files each):
    `data/pageTimes/` and `data/replication`. The former is considered
    as paradata while the latter is the behavioral data researchers are
    mainly interested in.

where the `Data.Name` column is then expanded in the subsequent
paragraphs, and `CEPR (2018)` is resolved in the References section of
the README.

The `processed` data data used to support the findings of this study
will be deposited in the some persistent repository. Until then, the
data is available in the [corresponding GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Howquez/GMTV). The data were collected by
the authors, and are available under a Creative Commons Non-commercial
license.

Some `GMTV` data were downloaded from GMTV (2017) other data was
provided by the authors upon request. More precisely, `GMTV-data.dta`
can be found in the [corresponding
appendix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272717300361#s0115).
A copy of the data is provided as part of this archive.
`GMTV-questionnaire-data.dta` was provided by the authors.

### Preliminary code during the pre-registration process

Code for data cleaning and analysis is provided as part of the
replication package. It is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Howquez/GMTV/tree/main/analysis) for review.
Together with all the other materials, it will be uploaded to the
journal repository once the paper has been conditionally accepted.

## Computational requirements

I created two dependency graphs of R packages used for the
pre-registered scripts and the article's analysis. These graphs should
help the replicator to reconstruct the computational environment I used.
Due to problems with the `renv` package, I decided to use `rang` which
is documented [here](https://github.com/chainsawriot/rang).

The corresponding graphs are stored in `analysis/requirements/` where
you can find R scripts as well as `rda` files. Run the former to install
the timestamped R packages when I used them or use the latter for
dockerization (see rang documentation).

Alternatively, just try to run my scripts and hope for smooth
executions.

Below, you'll find the packages and -versions I used as human readable
lists.

YEAR) desktop machine:

-   [x] \<15 minutes
-   [ ] 15-60 minutes
-   [ ] 1-2 hours
-   [ ] 2-8 hours
-   [ ] 8-24 hours

-   [ ] 3-14 days
-   [ ] \> 14 days
-   [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described below.

#### Details

The code was last run on a **8-core Intel-based laptop with MacOS
version 13.0**.

## Description of programs/code

> INSTRUCTIONS: Give a high-level overview of the program files and
> their purpose. Remove redundant/ obsolete files from the Replication
> archive.

-   Programs in `programs/01_dataprep` will extract and reformat all
    datasets referenced above. The file `programs/01_dataprep/main.do`
    will run them all.
-   Programs in `programs/02_analysis` generate all tables and figures
    in the main body of the article. The program
    `programs/02_analysis/main.do` will run them all. Each program
    called from `main.do` identifies the table or figure it creates
    (e.g., `05_table5.do`). Output files are called appropriate names
    (`table5.tex`, `figure12.png`) and should be easy to correlate with
    the manuscript.
-   Programs in `programs/03_appendix` will generate all tables and
    figures in the online appendix. The program
    `programs/03_appendix/main-appendix.do` will run them all.
-   Ado files have been stored in `programs/ado` and the `main.do` files
    set the ADO directories appropriately.
-   The program `programs/00_setup.do` will populate the `programs/ado`
    directory with updated ado packages, but for purposes of exact
    reproduction, this is not needed. The file `programs/00_setup.log`
    identifies the versions as they were last updated.
-   The program `programs/config.do` contains parameters used by all
    programs, including a random seed. Note that the random seed is set
    once for each of the two sequences (in `02_analysis` and
    `03_appendix`). If running in any order other than the one outlined
    below, your results may differ.

## Instructions to Replicators

> INSTRUCTIONS: The first two sections ensure that the data and software
> necessary to conduct the replication have been collected. This section
> then describes a human-readable instruction to conduct the
> replication. This may be simple, or may involve many complicated
> steps. It should be a simple list, no excess prose. Strict linear
> sequence. If more than 4-5 manual steps, please wrap a main
> program/Makefile around them, in logical sequences. Examples follow.

-   Edit `programs/config.do` to adjust the default path
-   Run `programs/00_setup.do` once on a new system to set up the
    working environment.
-   Download the data files referenced above. Each should be stored in
    the prepared subdirectories of `data/`, in the format that you
    download them in. Do not unzip. Scripts are provided in each
    directory to download the public-use files. Confidential data files
    requested as part of your FSRDC project will appear in the `/data`
    folder. No further action is needed on the replicator's part.
-   Run `programs/01_main.do` to run all steps in sequence.

### Details

-   `programs/00_setup.do`: will create all output directories, install
    needed ado packages.
    -   If wishing to update the ado packages used by this archive,
        change the parameter `update_ado` to `yes`. However, this is not
        needed to successfully reproduce the manuscript tables.
-   `programs/01_dataprep`:
    -   These programs were last run at various times in 2018.
    -   Order does not matter, all programs can be run in parallel, if
        needed.
    -   A `programs/01_dataprep/main.do` will run them all in sequence,
        which should take about 2 hours.
-   `programs/02_analysis/main.do`.
    -   If running programs individually, note that ORDER IS IMPORTANT.
    -   The programs were last run top to bottom on July 4, 2019.
-   `programs/03_appendix/main-appendix.do`. The programs were last run
    top to bottom on July 4, 2019.
-   Figure 1: The figure can be reproduced using the data provided in
    the folder "2_data/data_map", and ArcGIS Desktop (Version 10.7.1) by
    following these (manual) instructions:
    -   Create a new map document in ArcGIS ArcMap, browse to the folder
        "2_data/data_map" in the "Catalog", with files
        "provinceborders.shp", "lakes.shp", and "cities.shp".
    -   Drop the files listed above onto the new map, creating three
        separate layers. Order them with "lakes" in the top layer and
        "cities" in the bottom layer.
    -   Right-click on the cities file, in properties choose the
        variable "health"... (more details)
